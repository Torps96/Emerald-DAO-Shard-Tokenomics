## Tokens
Emerald DAO have created two types of tokens, a non-fungible token (NFT) and a fungible token (FT).

### Non-Fungible Token: Emeralds
There are two types of NFTs to give you access to the Emerald DAO:
 * Genesis Emerald: 100 tokens. *Policy ID: 1cad64fda64efd18c2379e53543b14dfe5b3ecb273794ab630acf59c*
 * Regular Emerald: 2,000 tokens.   *Policy ID: c7e043870f52b06b55f9003fdb2de82646066592c0eb054c8d763b92*

There are 100 Genesis Emeralds and 953 Regular Emeralds currently circulating in supply.
The remaining supply (1,047 Regular Emeralds) will be minted on a future date to be decided by a community vote.

#### Benefits of Membership
Each emerald held (Genesis or Regular) gives you one voting power in polls within the Emerald DAO discord.

The $Shard token is the official token of the Emerald NFT DAO. $Shards will be the fuel that powers the Emerald DAO ecosystem.

*$Shard Policy ID:*

#### Token Distribution
There will be 13,000,000 $Shard total.

$Shard tokens are required to be claimed on a **weekly** basis by Emerald holders.
To claim tokens holders will send 2 ada to an address, then receive back $Shard tokens and the ada (minus transaction fees).

**You will only need to send one transaction per week to receive back all $Shard tokens based on the number of emeralds you hold in your wallet.**

$Shard will be distributed as follows:
 * *2 Week Early Access Period*: 
    * Genesis Emerald = 700 $Shard weekly
    * Regular Emerald = 139.69 $Shard weekly
    * $Shard distributed = 406,250 (3.125% Supply)
 * *0-6 Months Period*:
    * Genesis Emerald = 500 $Shard weekly
    * Regular Emerald = 100 $Shard weekly
    * $Shard distributed = 6,500,000 (50% Supply)

    * Genesis Emerald = 250 $Shard weekly
    * Regular Emerald = 50 $Shard weekly
    * $Shard distributed = 3,250,000 (25% Supply)
