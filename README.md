# Emerald DAO Tokenomics

## Intro
The Emerald DAO is one of the first democratic community wallets on the Cardano blockchain. The DAO intends to use "wisdom of the crowd" to outperform the average investor's ROI and share the profits amongst Emerald owners whilst also giving access to members to NFTs they could not usually invest in themselves. 

In future, our goal is to become a fully fledged DAO once this functionality is available on the Cardano blockchain.

This article will outline details on the Emerald DAOs tokens, their distributions and utlities.

## Community Wallet
The Emerald DAO community wallet is funded by minting income and royalties from sales on secondary marketplaces. 65% of funds received go to the community wallet, 25% to the team and 10% for marketing purposes.

The community wallet can be viewed here: https://pool.pm/addr1q9p9962ha5f2j607zmhgf7lhzp79vfxa62zeckal5c5rtfz76ejjl5xauk2fukdh7mjeaxcv3zt6jls0w73p4qxahffq4pflcp

## Tokens
Emerald DAO have built two types of tokens, a Cardano non-fungible token (CNFT) and a Cardano fungible token (CFT).

### Cardano Non-Fungible Token (CNFT): Emeralds
There are two types of NFTs which grant you access to the Emerald DAO:
 * Genesis Emerald: 100 tokens. **Policy ID: 1cad64fda64efd18c2379e53543b14dfe5b3ecb273794ab630acf59c**
 * Regular Emerald: 2,000 tokens.   **Policy ID: c7e043870f52b06b55f9003fdb2de82646066592c0eb054c8d763b92**

There is currently a circulating supply of 100 Genesis Emeralds and 953 Regular Emeralds. The remaining supply (1,047 Regular Emeralds) will be minted at a price of 60 ada on a date to be decided by the community.

#### Benefits of Membership:
Below outlines the current benefits of holding an Emerald:
   * Ability to vote on the DAO's actions, each Emerald held (Genesis or Regular) gives you 1 voting power in polls.
   * Closed discord rooms for discussions on projects, creation of proposals to buy projects and to partake in community contests with prizes.
   * Ability to claim $Shard tokens weekly.
   * Weekly giveaway for Emerald owners: Every week two Emerald holders will be chosen by random to receive ADA to their wallet. Emeralds must be held in your wallet and not listed on secondary marketplaces.
   * Monthly NFT giveaway for Emerald owners: Every month an Emerald holder will be chosen by random to receive an NFT to their wallet. Some months will have more NFTs sent depending on the community wallet and collaborations with projects.
   * Whitelist Spots Giveaway: Whenever we partner with projects Emerald holders will be chosen by random to receive whitelist spots to mint said project.
   * Use of community wallet NFTs as profile pictures: Emerald owners will be able to use NFTs in the community wallets as their profile picture with a small edit of an Emerald added to the picture.

Benefits of holding an Emerald are not limited to the above, there will be additional features added in the future.

#### Genesis vs Regular Emeralds:
Below outlines the difference between Genesis and Regular Emeralds:
  * Genesis Emeralds have 5 times the chance of winning a raffle/giveaway/whitelist spot than a Regular Emerald does.
  * Genesis Emeralds will earn 5 times the number of $Shard tokens a Regular Emerald does. 
  * Genesis Emeralds will have future utility that regular emeralds do not have, TBA.

### Fungible Token: $Shard Token
The $Shard token is the official token of the Emerald NFT DAO. $Shard is a utility token for the Emerald DAO, not a governance token. $Shards will be the fuel that powers the Emerald DAO ecosystem.

*$Shard Policy ID: To be posted*

#### Token Distribution:
There will be a total supply of 13,000,000 $Shard.

$Shard tokens are required to be claimed on a **weekly** basis by Emerald holders.
To claim tokens holders will send 2 ada to an address, then receive back $Shard tokens and the ada (minus transaction fees).

**You will only need to send one transaction per week to receive back all $Shard tokens related to the number of Genesis and Regular Emeralds held in your wallet.**

$Shard will be distributed as follows:
 * *2 Week Early Access Period*: 
    * Genesis Emerald = 700 $Shard weekly
    * Regular Emerald = 139.69 $Shard weekly
    * $Shard distributed = 406,250 (3.125% Supply)
 * *0-6 Months Period*:
    * Genesis Emerald = 500 $Shard weekly
    * Regular Emerald = 100 $Shard weekly
    * $Shard distributed = 6,500,000 (50% Supply)
 * *6-12 Months Period (1st Halving)*:
    * Genesis Emerald = 250 $Shard weekly
    * Regular Emerald = 50 $Shard weekly
    * $Shard distributed = 3,250,000 (25% Supply)
 * *12-18 Months Period (2nd Halving)*: 
    * Genesis Emerald = 125 $Shard weekly
    * Regular Emerald = 25 $Shard weekly
    * $Shard distributed = 1,625,000 (12.5% Supply)
 * *18-24 Months Period (3rd Halving)*: 
    * Genesis Emerald = 62.5 $Shard weekly
    * Regular Emerald = 12.5 $Shard weekly
    * $Shard distributed = 812,500 (6.25% Supply)
 * *24-30 Months Period (4th Halving)*: 
    * Genesis Emerald = 31.25 $Shard weekly
    * Regular Emerald = 6.25 $Shard weekly
    * $Shard distributed = 406,250 (3.125% Supply)

The table below helps visualise this distribution:

The early access period for two weeks has been chosen to reward the earliest investors in the DAO.

*We will let the community decide what happens with any unclaimed $Shards. For example, burn them, use for giveaways or send them to the community wallet.*

### $Shard Utility
$Shard usecases will be revealed in more detail in due course. Below briefly outlines plans:

 * **Skins**: Ability to spend $Shard token on upgrading your Emerald to a new 'skin' out of a choice of Emerald, Ruby, Amethyst, Diamond. Each skin will give you whitelist access to a PFP Collection. *More details to follow*
 * **PFP Collection**: Holding skins give whitelist access to a PFP collection. The PFP collection can be minted with $Shard tokens. *More details to follow*
 * **And more to be announced!**

*Please note usecases are also subject to change depending on community votes*

### $Shard Marketcap
The value of $Shard can be determined by a number of factors:
  * The circulating supply of $Shard
  * The utility of the $Shard tokens
  * The value of the DAOs assets in the community wallet
  * The potential growth in value of the DAOs assets over time

Although we will aim to be listed on all marketplaces we will not speculate on the equivalent ADA value of one $Shard over time. The community will decide how they want to value the token and use its utility within our ecosystem.
