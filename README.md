# Emerald DAO Tokenomics

## Intro
The Emerald DAO is *finish this section with explanation of DAO*

## Community Wallet
The Emerald DAO community wallet is funded by minting income and royalties from sales on secondary marketplaces. 65% of funds received go to the community wallet, 25% to the team and 10% for marketing purposes.

The community wallet can be viewed here: https://pool.pm/addr1q9p9962ha5f2j607zmhgf7lhzp79vfxa62zeckal5c5rtfz76ejjl5xauk2fukdh7mjeaxcv3zt6jls0w73p4qxahffq4pflcp

## Tokens
Emerald DAO have built two types of tokens, a Cardano non-fungible token (CNFT) and a fungible token (FT).

### Cardano Non-Fungible Token (CNFT): Emeralds
There are two types of NFTs which grant you access to the Emerald DAO:
 * Genesis Emerald: 100 tokens. **Policy ID: 1cad64fda64efd18c2379e53543b14dfe5b3ecb273794ab630acf59c**
 * Regular Emerald: 2,000 tokens.   **Policy ID: c7e043870f52b06b55f9003fdb2de82646066592c0eb054c8d763b92**

There is currently a circulating supply of 100 Genesis Emeralds and 953 Regular Emeralds. The remaining supply (1,047 Regular Emeralds) will be minted on a future date to be decided by a community vote.

#### Benefits of Membership:
Below outlines the current benefits of holding an Emerald:
   * Ability to vote on the DAO's actions, each Emerald held (Genesis or Regular) gives you 1 voting right.
   * Closed discord rooms for discussion of projects, creating proposals to buy projects and to partake in community contests with prizes.
   * Ability to claim $Shard tokens weekly.
   * Weekly giveaway for Emerald owners: Every week two Emerald holders will be chosen by random to receive ADA to their wallet. Emeralds must be held in your wallet and not listed on secondary marketplaces.
   * Monthly NFT giveaway for Emerald owners: Every month an Emerald holder will be chosen by random to receive an NFT to their wallet. Some months will have more NFTs sent depending on the community wallet and collabs with other projects.
   * Whitelist Spots Giveaway: Whenever we partner with projects Emerald holders will be chosen by random to receive whitelist spots to mint the project.
   * Use of community wallet NFTs as profile pictures: Emerald owners will be able to use NFTs in the community wallets as their profile picture with a small edit of an Emerald added to the picture.

Benefits of holding an Emerald are not limited to the above, there will be additional features added in the future.

#### Genesis vs Regular Emeralds:
Below outlines the difference between Genesis and Regular Emeralds:
  * Genesis Emeralds have 5 times the chance of winning a raffle/giveaway/whitelist spot than a regular emerald does.
  * Genesis Emeralds will earn 5 times the number of $Shard tokens a Regular Emerald does. 
  * Genesis Emeralds will have future utility that regular emeralds do not have, TBA.

### Fungible Token: $Shard Token
The $Shard token is the official token of the Emerald NFT DAO. $Shards will be the fuel that powers the Emerald DAO ecosystem.

*$Shard Policy ID:*

#### Token Distribution:
There will be a total supply of 13,000,000 $Shard.

$Shard tokens are required to be claimed on a **weekly** basis by Emerald holders.
To claim tokens holders will send 2 ada to an address, then receive back $Shard tokens and the ada (minus transaction fees).

**You will only need to send one transaction per week to receive back all $Shard tokens related to the number of Genesis and Regular Emeralds held in your wallet.**

$Shard will be distributed as follows:
 * *2 Week Early Access Period*: 
    * Genesis Emerald = 700 $Shard weekly
    * Regular Emerald = 139.69 $Shard weekly
    * $Shard distributed = 406,250 (3.125% Supply)
 * *0-6 Months Period*:
    * Genesis Emerald = 500 $Shard weekly
    * Regular Emerald = 100 $Shard weekly
    * $Shard distributed = 6,500,000 (50% Supply)
 * *6-12 Months Period (1st Halving)*:
    * Genesis Emerald = 250 $Shard weekly
    * Regular Emerald = 50 $Shard weekly
    * $Shard distributed = 3,250,000 (25% Supply)
 * *12-18 Months Period (2nd Halving)*: 
    * Genesis Emerald = 125 $Shard weekly
    * Regular Emerald = 25 $Shard weekly
    * $Shard distributed = 1,625,000 (12.5% Supply)
 * *18-24 Months Period (3rd Halving)*: 
    * Genesis Emerald = 125 $Shard weekly
    * Regular Emerald = 25 $Shard weekly
    * $Shard distributed = 812,500 (6.25% Supply)
 * *24-30 Months Period (4th Halving)*: 
    * Genesis Emerald = 125 $Shard weekly
    * Regular Emerald = 25 $Shard weekly
    * $Shard distributed = 406,250 (3.125% Supply)

There is an early access period in the distribution to reward the earliest investors in the DAO.

*We will let the community decide what happens with any unclaimed $Shards. For example, burn them, use for giveaways or send them to the community wallet.*

### $Shard Usecases
$Shard usecases will be revealed in more detail in due course. Below briefly outlines plans:

 * **Skins**: You will be able to spend your $Shard token on upgrading your Emerald to a new Gem 'skin' out of a choice of Ruby, Amethyst, Diamond. These skins will be used in future for mints & such *idk what to write here really* 
 * **Other Usecases**: *Tcd and saharzzz tell meeeeee*

*Please note usecases are subject to change depending on community votes*

### Value of $Shard
The marketcap of $Shard should be determined by a number of factors:
  * The value of the DAOs assets in the community wallet
  * The potential growth in value of the DAOs assets over time
  * The usecases of the $Shard tokens

To estimate the value of one $Shard token you can use the following calculation:

  **Estimate $Shard price = Value of DAOs Assets / Circulating Supply of $Shard**  
  
We have provided the following example below to demonstrate this calculation. In this example we estimate the value of a $Shard in one year's time based on the DAOs assets doubling in value:
